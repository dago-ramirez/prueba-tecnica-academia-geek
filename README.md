## Technical test app

This is a single page nano-site with the kinds of forms and validations that we normally do in a web application.
This web application customizes the use of Github.

## Set up

You'll need Node.js on your local development machine.

### Clone the repo
### Run $ `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Up and running

##Run $ `npm start`
Visit http://localhost:3000

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
